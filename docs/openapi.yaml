  title: Local REST API for Obsidian
  description: |
    You can use this interface for trying out your Local REST API in Obsidian.

    Before trying the below tools, you will want to make sure you press the "Authorize" button below and provide the API Key you are shown when you open the "Local REST API" section of your Obsidian settings.  All requests to the API require a valid API Key; so you won't get very far without doing that.

    When using this tool you may see browser security warnings due to your browser not trusting the self-signed certificate the plugin will generate on its first run.  If you do, you can make those errors disappear by adding the certificate as a "Trusted Certificate" in your browser or operating system's settings.

        Insert content into the currently open note in Obsidian relative to a heading within that document.
      description: |
        Inserts content into the currently-open note relative to a heading within that note.

        This is useful if you have a document having multiple headings, and you would like to insert content below one of those headings.  For example, if you had the following document:

        ```markdown
        # An important subject

        ## Details

        # Another important subject

        ## Details
        ```

        You could insert content below "Another important subject" by providing `Another important subject` in your `Heading` header.

        By default, this will find the first heading matching the name you specify.  If your heading appears more than once in a document, you can control which heading is used by indicating parent headings with the `::` delimiter. 

        For example, if you would like your content to be inserted after the heading "Details" below "Another important subject" in the above document, you could provide the value `Another important subject::Details` in your `Heading` header.

        If on the off chance the string "::" occurs in your headers, you can override the delimiter used for separating headers from one another via the `Heading-Boundary` header.
      parameters:
      - name: Heading

        Insert content into a periodic note relative to a heading within that document.
      description: |
        Inserts content into an existing note relative to a heading within your note.

        This is useful if you have a document having multiple headings, and you would like to insert content below one of those headings.  For example, if you had the following document:

        ```markdown
        # An important subject

        ## Details

        # Another important subject

        ## Details
        ```

        You could insert content below "Another important subject" by providing `Another important subject` in your `Heading` header.

        By default, this will find the first heading matching the name you specify.  If your heading appears more than once in a document, you can control which heading is used by indicating parent headings with the `::` delimiter. 

        For example, if you would like your content to be inserted after the heading "Details" below "Another important subject" in the above document, you could provide the value `Another important subject::Details` in your `Heading` header.

        If on the off chance the string "::" occurs in your headers, you can override the delimiter used for separating headers from one another via the `Heading-Boundary` header.
      parameters:
      - $ref: '#/components/parameters/period'

        Evaluates a provided query against each file in your vault.

        This endpoint supports multiple query formats.  Your query should be specified in your request's body, and will be interpreted according to the `Content-type` header you specify from the below options.Additional query formats may be added in the future.

        # Dataview DQL (`application/vnd.olrapi.dataview.dql+txt`)

        Accepts a `TABLE`-type Dataview query as a text string.  See [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/query/queries/)'s query documentation for information on how to construct a query.

        # JsonLogic (`application/vnd.olrapi.jsonlogic+json`)

        Accepts a JsonLogic query specified as JSON.  See [JsonLogic](https://jsonlogic.com/operations.html)'s documentation for information about the base set of operators available, but in addition to those operators the following operators are available:

        - `glob: [PATTERN, VALUE]`: Returns `true` if a string matches a glob pattern.  E.g.: `{"glob": ["*.foo", "bar.foo"]}` is `true` and `{"glob": ["*.bar", "bar.foo"]}` is `false`.
        - `regexp: [PATTERN, VALUE]`: Returns `true` if a string matches a regular expression.  E.g.: `{"regexp": [".*\.foo", "bar.foo"]` is `true` and `{"regexp": [".*\.bar", "bar.foo"]}` is `false`.

        Returns only non-falsy results.  "Non-falsy" here treats the following values as "falsy":

        - `false`
        - `null` or `undefined`
        - `0`
        - `[]`
        - `{}`

        Files are represented as an object having the schema described
        in the Schema named 'NoteJson' at the bottom of this page.
        Understanding the shape of a JSON object from a schema can be
        tricky; so you may find it helpful to examine the generated metadata
        for individual files in your vault to understand exactly what values
        are returned.  To see that, access the `GET` `/vault/{filePath}`
        route setting the header:
        `Accept: application/vnd.olrapi.note+json`.  See examples below
        for working examples of queries performing common search operations.
