    You can use this interface for trying out your Local REST API in Obsidian.
    
    Before trying the below tools, you will want to make sure you press the "Authorize" button below and provide the API Key you are shown when you open the "Local REST API" section of your Obsidian settings.  All requests to the API require a valid API Key; so you won't get very far without doing that.
    
    When using this tool you may see browser security warnings due to your browser not trusting the self-signed certificate the plugin will generate on its first run.  If you do, you can make those errors disappear by adding the certificate as a "Trusted Certificate" in your browser or operating system's settings.

        # Examples
        
        All of the below examples assume you have a document that looks like
        this:
        
        ```markdown
        ---
        alpha: 1
        beta: test
        delta:
        zeta: 1
        yotta: 1
        gamma:
        - one
        - two
        ---
        
        # Heading 1
        
        This is the content for heading one
        
        Also references some [[#^484ef2]]
        
        ## Subheading 1:1
        Content for Subheading 1:1
        
        ### Subsubheading 1:1:1
        
        ### Subsubheading 1:1:2
        
        Testing how block references work for a table.[[#^2c7cfa]]
        Some content for Subsubheading 1:1:2
        
        More random text.
        
        ^2d9b4a
        
        ## Subheading 1:2
        
        Content for Subheading 1:2.
        
        some content with a block reference ^484ef2
        
        ## Subheading 1:3
        | City         | Population |
        | ------------ | ---------- |
        | Seattle, WA  | 8          |
        | Portland, OR | 4          |
        
        ^2c7cfa
        ```
        
        ## Append Content Below a Heading
        
        If you wanted to append the content "Hello" below "Subheading 1:1:1" under "Heading 1",
        you could send a request with the following headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `append`
        - `Target-Type`: `heading`
        - `Target`: `Heading 1::Subheading 1:1:1`
        - with the request body: `Hello`
        
        The above would work just fine for `prepend` or `replace`, too, of course,
        but with different results.
        
        ## Append Content to a Block Reference
        
        If you wanted to append the content "Hello" below the block referenced by
        "2d9b4a" above ("More random text."), you could send the following headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `append`
        - `Target-Type`: `block`
        - `Target`: `2d9b4a`
        - with the request body: `Hello`
        
        The above would work just fine for `prepend` or `replace`, too, of course,
        but with different results.
        
        ## Add a Row to a Table Referenced by a Block Reference
        
        If you wanted to add a new city ("Chicago, IL") and population ("16") pair to the table above
        referenced by the block reference `2c7cfa`, you could send the following
        headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `append`
        - `TargetType`: `block`
        - `Target`: `2c7cfa`
        - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
        - with the request body: `[["Chicago, IL", "16"]]`
        
        The use of a `Content-Type` of `application/json` allows the API
        to infer that member of your array represents rows and columns of your
        to append to the referenced table.  You can of course just use a
        `Content-Type` of `text/markdown`, but in such a case you'll have to
        format your table row manually instead of letting the library figure
        it out for you.
        
        You also have the option of using `prepend` (in which case, your new
        row would be the first -- right below the table heading) or `replace` (in which
        case all rows except the table heading would be replaced by the new row(s)
        you supplied).
        
        ## Setting a Frontmatter Field
        
        If you wanted to set the frontmatter field `alpha` to `2`, you could
        send the following headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `replace`
        - `TargetType`: `frontmatter`
        - `Target`: `beep`
        - with the request body `2`
        
        If you're setting a frontmatter field that might not already exist
        you may want to use the `Create-Target-If-Missing` header so the
        new frontmatter field is created and set to your specified value
        if it doesn't already exist.
        
        You may find using a `Content-Type` of `application/json` to be
        particularly useful in the case of frontmatter since frontmatter
        fields' values are JSON data, and the API can be smarter about
        interpreting yoru `prepend` or `append` requests if you specify
        your data as JSON (particularly when appending, for example,
        list items).

        Inserts content into an existing note relative to a heading within your note.
        
        Allows you to modify the content relative to a heading, block reference, or frontmatter field in your document.
        
        Note that this API was changed in Version 3.0 of this extension and the earlier PATCH API is now deprecated. Requests made using the previous version of this API will continue to work until Version 4.0 is released.  See https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api/wiki/Changes-to-PATCH-requests-between-versions-2.0-and-3.0 for more details and migration instructions.
        
        # Examples
        
        All of the below examples assume you have a document that looks like
        this:
        
        ```markdown
        ---
        alpha: 1
        beta: test
        delta:
        zeta: 1
        yotta: 1
        gamma:
        - one
        - two
        ---
        
        # Heading 1
        
        This is the content for heading one
        
        Also references some [[#^484ef2]]
        
        ## Subheading 1:1
        Content for Subheading 1:1
        
        ### Subsubheading 1:1:1
        
        ### Subsubheading 1:1:2
        
        Testing how block references work for a table.[[#^2c7cfa]]
        Some content for Subsubheading 1:1:2
        
        More random text.
        
        ^2d9b4a
        
        ## Subheading 1:2
        
        Content for Subheading 1:2.
        
        some content with a block reference ^484ef2
        
        ## Subheading 1:3
        | City         | Population |
        | ------------ | ---------- |
        | Seattle, WA  | 8          |
        | Portland, OR | 4          |
        
        ^2c7cfa
        ```
        
        ## Append Content Below a Heading
        
        If you wanted to append the content "Hello" below "Subheading 1:1:1" under "Heading 1",
        you could send a request with the following headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `append`
        - `Target-Type`: `heading`
        - `Target`: `Heading 1::Subheading 1:1:1`
        - with the request body: `Hello`
        
        The above would work just fine for `prepend` or `replace`, too, of course,
        but with different results.
        
        ## Append Content to a Block Reference
        
        If you wanted to append the content "Hello" below the block referenced by
        "2d9b4a" above ("More random text."), you could send the following headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `append`
        - `Target-Type`: `block`
        - `Target`: `2d9b4a`
        - with the request body: `Hello`
        
        The above would work just fine for `prepend` or `replace`, too, of course,
        but with different results.
        
        ## Add a Row to a Table Referenced by a Block Reference
        
        If you wanted to add a new city ("Chicago, IL") and population ("16") pair to the table above
        referenced by the block reference `2c7cfa`, you could send the following
        headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `append`
        - `TargetType`: `block`
        - `Target`: `2c7cfa`
        - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
        - with the request body: `[["Chicago, IL", "16"]]`
        
        The use of a `Content-Type` of `application/json` allows the API
        to infer that member of your array represents rows and columns of your
        to append to the referenced table.  You can of course just use a
        `Content-Type` of `text/markdown`, but in such a case you'll have to
        format your table row manually instead of letting the library figure
        it out for you.
        
        You also have the option of using `prepend` (in which case, your new
        row would be the first -- right below the table heading) or `replace` (in which
        case all rows except the table heading would be replaced by the new row(s)
        you supplied).
        
        ## Setting a Frontmatter Field
        
        If you wanted to set the frontmatter field `alpha` to `2`, you could
        send the following headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `replace`
        - `TargetType`: `frontmatter`
        - `Target`: `beep`
        - with the request body `2`
        
        If you're setting a frontmatter field that might not already exist
        you may want to use the `Create-Target-If-Missing` header so the
        new frontmatter field is created and set to your specified value
        if it doesn't already exist.
        
        You may find using a `Content-Type` of `application/json` to be
        particularly useful in the case of frontmatter since frontmatter
        fields' values are JSON data, and the API can be smarter about
        interpreting yoru `prepend` or `append` requests if you specify
        your data as JSON (particularly when appending, for example,
        list items).

        Evaluates a provided query against each file in your vault.
        
        This endpoint supports multiple query formats.  Your query should be specified in your request's body, and will be interpreted according to the `Content-type` header you specify from the below options.Additional query formats may be added in the future.
        
        # Dataview DQL (`application/vnd.olrapi.dataview.dql+txt`)
        
        Accepts a `TABLE`-type Dataview query as a text string.  See [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/query/queries/)'s query documentation for information on how to construct a query.
        
        # JsonLogic (`application/vnd.olrapi.jsonlogic+json`)
        
        Accepts a JsonLogic query specified as JSON.  See [JsonLogic](https://jsonlogic.com/operations.html)'s documentation for information about the base set of operators available, but in addition to those operators the following operators are available:
        
        - `glob: [PATTERN, VALUE]`: Returns `true` if a string matches a glob pattern.  E.g.: `{"glob": ["*.foo", "bar.foo"]}` is `true` and `{"glob": ["*.bar", "bar.foo"]}` is `false`.
        - `regexp: [PATTERN, VALUE]`: Returns `true` if a string matches a regular expression.  E.g.: `{"regexp": [".*\.foo", "bar.foo"]` is `true` and `{"regexp": [".*\.bar", "bar.foo"]}` is `false`.
        
        Returns only non-falsy results.  "Non-falsy" here treats the following values as "falsy":
        
        - `false`
        - `null` or `undefined`
        - `0`
        - `[]`
        - `{}`
        
        Files are represented as an object having the schema described
        in the Schema named 'NoteJson' at the bottom of this page.
        Understanding the shape of a JSON object from a schema can be
        tricky; so you may find it helpful to examine the generated metadata

        # Examples
        
        All of the below examples assume you have a document that looks like
        this:
        
        ```markdown
        ---
        alpha: 1
        beta: test
        delta:
        zeta: 1
        yotta: 1
        gamma:
        - one
        - two
        ---
        
        # Heading 1
        
        This is the content for heading one
        
        Also references some [[#^484ef2]]
        
        ## Subheading 1:1
        Content for Subheading 1:1
        
        ### Subsubheading 1:1:1
        
        ### Subsubheading 1:1:2
        
        Testing how block references work for a table.[[#^2c7cfa]]
        Some content for Subsubheading 1:1:2
        
        More random text.
        
        ^2d9b4a
        
        ## Subheading 1:2
        
        Content for Subheading 1:2.
        
        some content with a block reference ^484ef2
        
        ## Subheading 1:3
        | City         | Population |
        | ------------ | ---------- |
        | Seattle, WA  | 8          |
        | Portland, OR | 4          |
        
        ^2c7cfa
        ```
        
        ## Append Content Below a Heading
        
        If you wanted to append the content "Hello" below "Subheading 1:1:1" under "Heading 1",
        you could send a request with the following headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `append`
        - `Target-Type`: `heading`
        - `Target`: `Heading 1::Subheading 1:1:1`
        - with the request body: `Hello`
        
        The above would work just fine for `prepend` or `replace`, too, of course,
        but with different results.
        
        ## Append Content to a Block Reference
        
        If you wanted to append the content "Hello" below the block referenced by
        "2d9b4a" above ("More random text."), you could send the following headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `append`
        - `Target-Type`: `block`
        - `Target`: `2d9b4a`
        - with the request body: `Hello`
        
        The above would work just fine for `prepend` or `replace`, too, of course,
        but with different results.
        
        ## Add a Row to a Table Referenced by a Block Reference
        
        If you wanted to add a new city ("Chicago, IL") and population ("16") pair to the table above
        referenced by the block reference `2c7cfa`, you could send the following
        headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `append`
        - `TargetType`: `block`
        - `Target`: `2c7cfa`
        - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
        - with the request body: `[["Chicago, IL", "16"]]`
        
        The use of a `Content-Type` of `application/json` allows the API
        to infer that member of your array represents rows and columns of your
        to append to the referenced table.  You can of course just use a
        `Content-Type` of `text/markdown`, but in such a case you'll have to
        format your table row manually instead of letting the library figure
        it out for you.
        
        You also have the option of using `prepend` (in which case, your new
        row would be the first -- right below the table heading) or `replace` (in which
        case all rows except the table heading would be replaced by the new row(s)
        you supplied).
        
        ## Setting a Frontmatter Field
        
        If you wanted to set the frontmatter field `alpha` to `2`, you could
        send the following headers:
        
        - `Operation`: `replace`
        - `TargetType`: `frontmatter`
        - `Target`: `beep`
        - with the request body `2`
        
        If you're setting a frontmatter field that might not already exist
        you may want to use the `Create-Target-If-Missing` header so the
        new frontmatter field is created and set to your specified value
        if it doesn't already exist.
        
        You may find using a `Content-Type` of `application/json` to be
        particularly useful in the case of frontmatter since frontmatter
        fields' values are JSON data, and the API can be smarter about
        interpreting yoru `prepend` or `append` requests if you specify
        your data as JSON (particularly when appending, for example,
        list items).
